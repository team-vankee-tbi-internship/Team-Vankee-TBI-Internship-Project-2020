Main goal of the project is write small scripts in different languages with the next output in sdout - name, e-mail, used_language, biostack, slack_username. Next step is to make csv file with rows corresponding to the person and columns to the values (as name, e-mail, etc) in bash, using sdout from scripts.

Available via standard package managers R language Nodejs for javascript Linux (awk command must be recognisable in shell) Random GIF  üé® Running the tests Check if dependencies are satisfied Script for tests (tests.sh) is included in the repo. You can run it with the following command:  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Team-Rosalind/team-rosalind-project/master/tests.sh &amp;&amp; sh tests.sh The above command will download only the target script and check if all required software is already installed.  Installing missing dependencies Ubuntu sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install python octave julia gcc g++ r nodejs npm Please note, that Ubuntu-based installation hasn't been checked yet. Command based on Google search results. If you have any problems please report an issue and try official instruction for every package as stated on official sites  Arch-based distributions sudo pacman -Su &amp;&amp; sudo pacman -S python octave julia gcc nodejs npm Installing The main goal of the project is to create a bash script that will clone the repo and produce a csv file with the participants' personal information. For this goal no installation is required, however check if all dependencies are satisfied.  üìú Flowchart WorkFlow_HackBio Made using diagrams.net  üîß Usage Please download the following script csv-producer.sh. Downloading and running the script can be done from a terminal with the following command:  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Team-Rosalind/team-rosalind-project/master/csv-producer.sh &amp;&amp; sh csv-producer.sh Script is intended to work in Linux-based systems and Windows PowerShell.

(Novice Friendly) Complete task 2 (multiple languages) Make a simple bash script for git commit Language check  Python  Julia  C++  R  Java  MATLAB  Javascript  C Note: The checklist has 8 languages right now. The minimum required amount is 7. If it is not satisfied, please choose unchecked languages from a list.  I am not a coder, what should I choose? Everyone began from something (: Actually the language in this task doesn't matter, as the script is very simple. You can search smth similar to "write hello world script in language_of_interest ".  If all of the languages are checked, and the requirements (about programming language variety) are satisfied, you are free to choose whatever language you like. A good start is to become more familiar with R or Python. Both of these languages are extremely popular within the bioinformatics community. See templates for "Hello world script" for R and Python.  Unified template for output Human text is an excellent example of unstructured data. Desired fields (for this task) can be printed out in many different ways. Therefore I propose a unified template for your script output:  NAME: *Your full name* E-MAIL: *Your e-mail*  USED LANGUAGE: *Name of used scripted language. All letters are capital* BIOSTACK: *Name of biostack you chose. The only first letter is capital*  SLACK USERNAME: @+*username* An example:  NAME: Pavlo Hrab E-MAIL: pavlo.hrab@lnu.edu.ua USED LANGUAGE: JULIA BIOSTACK: Genomics SLACK USERNAME: @pavlo  After you get the desired output, please name your file stage_0_slack-username An example: stage_0_pavlo.jl  Generate a new table of content The table of content was generated here Please if you do any updates to file itself, update a table of content as well  üöÄ Contributing Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to be learn, inspire, and create.
